## Hi there ðŸ˜„

### My name is Bry (pronouns he/him), and welcome to my wonderful journey of learning to be a developer!

ðŸŒ± I am currently in the process of learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS with plans to learn Python, Ruby, and SQL in the near future!
<br>
<br>
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for help to streamline and better my coding practices, so please feel free to backseat on any of my projects and throw some tips and tricks my way!
<br>
<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: Gaming is my biggest hobby, and Genshin Impact is my all-time favorite video game. I have _almost_ all of the 5 star characters in the game (RIP my wallet)!
<br>
